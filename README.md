# Frog leap rails
good-2-knows when speed learning rails

**Initiation**
It is assumed that you have rails installed. If not find a tutorial on how to do that before continueing.

1. New project: rails new <project_name>

2. cd in to project:
  
  If you want it to be git repo do:
  
  git init
  
  git add .
  
  git commit -m "initial commit"
  
3. rails s (start server to be able to use it on localhost)

if you need to run on other port do ```rails s -p 3007``` - default is 3000

4. Then go to localhost:<your chosen port>
